        <h2>Using the art</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can manually refresh or click anywhere on the page to refresh with a new random seed</li>
            <li>You can toggle the background color with the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>spacebar</kbd>. </li>
            <li>You can show the hidden prose by pressing <kbd>p</kbd>. This is based on local storage and requires a reload/resize.</li>
            <br />
            <b>Test controls: wont be in the final piece</b>
        
            <li>You can toggle a side window showing trait details by pressing <kbd>c</kbd></li>
            <li>You can turn off the animations by pressing the <kbd>n</kbd> key, nice for quickly viewing outputs. Some big peg animations can take 20s</li>
            <li>You can press <kbd>s</kbd> to view the seed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Project overview</h2>

        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        The work is purely JS / Canvas. No external libraries.
        
        <h3>Influence</h3>
        PbDi is influenced heavily by film narrative and the feeling of being in a theater (or drive in theater). Each piece includes generative prose and a screen like visual in an attempt to recreate the movie going experience, the feeling when the lights go down and a key scene plays out.
        
        Ideas that drove this:
        <ul>
        <li>Generative poetry (Especially slotted works, ie Alison Knowles / etc.)</li>
        <li>Micro fiction / plot synopsis / detective writing / action tropes</li>
        <li>Strange movie plots (Predator, Big Lebowski, Turner and Hooch)</li>
        <li>Retro video game text dialog</li>
        <li>Grids, microchips, and pegboards</li>
        <li>Letterpress offsets / Plotter layering</li>
        <li>Bauhaus design</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Artistic approach</h3>
        The artistic approcah is based on a variable grid of pegs (the pegboard) and different colors / outputs / crop are generated on top of behind it. Coming from a relief / screen printing background layers and opacity are very important to the visuals of the piece. Though it is a 2d work layering and opacity give depth. 
        
        <h4>Traits: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Background is white, black, or dark grey</li>
            <li>Grid size can vary in 10 different sizes. A single peg grid is an outlier at 1/1000.</li>
            <li>Color schemes generated are 3,5,9, and 10 palletes. Each produces a unique combination. </li>
            <li>There are 30 unique color schemes. Colors were inspired by a number of sources and very curated. Picked off of from things like an old t-shirt print, a sundown, a dixie cup, art, etc...</li>
            <li>There are 13 unique types of outputs *final list TBD* (weave, rings, blocks, puzzle, burst, gas, multiply, abacus, lines, bubble, diamond, pilled, webbed)</li>
            <li>Cropped (controls if there are areas where our output will not display, the pegs are untouched)</li>
            <li>Behind: true or false. Do the outputs happen on top of or behind the pegs</li>
            <li>Hyper: Any output on top lightens the peg underneath it</li>
            <li>SquarePeg: true or false. Is the peg round or square</li>
            <li>Noisy: true or false. Is noise texture applied.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Prose:</h4>
        The prose is very variable and dynamic but basically consists of 5 main prompts filled in with a combination of around 2100 unique words. I think there are around 100k combos possibe. Prose can sound absurdist (like many movies from the 80s) but should be structurally sound and make sense as a sentance. They are intentionally built to represent a movie plot or scene and allude to a larger story.

        I'd watch that.
